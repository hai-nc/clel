;; ** reader macro
;;
;; A convenient reader macro to generate a string verbatim from the text of the
;;   source code. This is to avoid a textual form being altered by the Lisp
;;   reader and then by the Swank processing and then gets misinterpreted when
;;   reaching to Emacs, by wrapping the form inside a string and makes Emacs
;;   evaluate this string.
;; 
;; The following reader macro code is adapted from lisper99's `cltcl' package:
